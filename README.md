# timeline-looper-remote

## Introduction

The [Strymon Timeline](https://www.strymon.net/product/timeline/) delay effect pedal features a 30-second looper.
To control the delay effect and the looper simultaneously I built a pedal equipped with an [Arduino nano](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano) that remote controls the looper via MIDI.

My pedal has four stomp switches and four LEDs and can control these functions of the looper:
* Record
* Play
* Stop
* Reverse (second page)
* Half speed (second page)
* Undo (second page)
* Decrease playback volume (second page)
