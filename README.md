# timeline-looper-remote

The [Strymon Timeline](https://www.strymon.net/product/timeline/) delay effect pedal features a 30-second looper. To control the delay effect and the looper simultaneously I built a pedal that remote controls the looper via MIDI.

My pedal has four stomp switches and four LEDs and can control these functions of the looper:
* Record
* Play
* Stop
* Reverse
* Half speed
* Undo
